# steam-auto-seller

> auto-sell items from your Steam inventory

Be careful, it's a just-for-fun project and not thoroughly tested. No guaranty or warranty for anything.

The price will be set to `(lowest_price / 1.15 - 0.02) â‚¬/$` aka 0.01 below the lowest current price (according to the Steam API).

## HowTo

Go to `steamcommunity.com` and login. Check the cookies (CTRL+i) and extract `sessionid` and `steamLoginSecure`.

Replace the value of `SESSION_ID` and `STEAM_LOGIN_SECURE` in the file `index.js` with the data from the cookie.

Run

```
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

This will automatically create sell orders for you Steam inventory (e.g. tradings card, etc.). One at a time due to limitations of the Steam web API.

Recommended: Logout from `steamcommunity.com` when you're done.

## Known Issues

* sometimes confirmation requests are stuck, just reset them on the "Market" page
* issues with the API, just re-run the tool

## TODO

* command-line input or login
* refactor code
